**Combining Data:** We merged data from different sources to analyze it together, ensuring a smooth integration.

**In-Depth Analysis:** We studied various aspects of the data, like content, reactions, sentiments, categories, and timing. This helped us uncover patterns, trends, and user preferences.

**Top Categories:** Based on total scores, we found the top 5 categories. These categories are likely to perform well in engagement.

**Content Analysis:** Photos are the most common content type (26.8%), followed by audio (23.0%), Gifs, and videos.

**Reaction Types:** The "Heart" reaction is the most popular, while reactions like "Cherish" are used less often.

**Time Analysis:** Social activity was highest in June 2021 and lowest in March 2021. Engagement remained relatively steady.

**Sentiment Analysis:** "Animals" had the highest positive sentiment score, while "Veganism" had the lowest. "Culture," "Education," and "Animals" had the highest mean sentiment scores.

**Client Message:**

We suggest the client focus on visually appealing content, especially photos, for better engagement. Exploring topics like animals, culture, and education, which have positive sentiment, could lead to successful engagement. By understanding social media dynamics, the client can optimize their content strategy and connect better with their audience.
